    Binded UI to ViewModel and created test cases.
    
    Linked MainWindow UI components to new class
    PasswordViewModel properties created in previous
    feature allows for automatic updating.
    generatePassword button now calls PasswordViewModel
    method direct.
    Validation of password is moved to PasswordViewModel
    and errorTextProperty displays invalid input message.
    Created test cases for PasswordViewModel testing
    all criteria for proper password generation.

    Added multiple options of classes to load recipes
    
    Created RecipeLoader with methods to return a list
    of recipes loaded from a file. If file cannot be
    returned then empty list is returned.

    class providing method definitions for loading
    recipes and loading recipes with a specified ingredient.
    Created RecipeFilePersistenceManager class that
    extends RecipeDataPersistenceManager to load recipes
    from a file.
    Setup establishes a foundational structure
    for managing recipe data persistence.
    Both implementations are redundant/interchangeable
    and logic from most appropriate implementations
    will be used for future features.

    Added test cases for convertRecipeToString() and
    writeRecipeToFile() checking for proper function
    of formatting recipe name/ingredients and for the
    successful writing of recipe to a file. Includes
    testing for proper exception handling of null or
    empty scenarios.
